  The Revisionist - MS Word document metadata analysis system 0.2b
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

============
INTRODUCTION
============

The Revisionist is a humble set of scripts I developed immediately
after releasing a write-up on the "hidden" data I managed to recover from
Microsoft's documents (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/strikeout/).

My primary goal is to provide pen-testers and content administrators with
a handy tool to detect hidden data in all documents available at a specific 
location (be it a locally mounted network share, a HTTP site, or whatnot),
and easily review it all. Right now, the tool only detects and indexes
deleted text in documents with "change tracking" enabled, and can also
index usernames and hardware addresses embedded in documents (to 
facilitate external assessment of company structure); future versions should
be able to recover other goodies, too.

=====
USAGE
=====

To run the tool against a local directory, a mounted SMB or NFS directory,
or such, simply issue the following command (after doing 'make', that is):

  ./therev '' @/path/to/directory

After the tool completes, you should be able to view 'master.html' in
current directory using your favourite browser (Lynx, Netscape, etc).
Cached copies of documents would be placed in subdirectories named
document.XXXXXX, where X is a random digit; hence, it is recommended
to run the tool in a separate directory.

Note that you may also instruct the tool to look for specific substring
and only choose those documents that contain it (strict checking, no 
regexp available):

  ./therev 'linux' @/path/to/directory

To run the program against a specific site or top-level domain, do
the following:

  ./therev '' site.com

Note that 'com', 'gov', 'gov.pl', 'www.microsoft.com' are all a valid
site name. The first parameter works similar to the previous case:

  ./therev 'homeland security' gov

As a special bonus, when running the script against multilinguinal sites,
you might want to specify a third parameter - desired language (using
a two-letter code: en, pl, etc). NOTE: DO NOT USE LANGUAGE QUALIFIER
UNLESS NECESSARY:

  ./therev 'linux' microsoft.com en

The HTTP search mode uses Google.com to locate all matching Word documents
on a specific site. For a document to be found, it must be indexable 
(that is, not excluded in robots.txt) and be in the first 1000 of results
for a specific site. If there are more than 1000 documents at some
website, consider sub-searches with keywords.

================================
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HTTP SEARCH
================================

WARNING: This engine may violate Google Terms of Service when used in
HTTP search mode. Although this code does not generate a massive
volume of requests (max. 10 per search), it is still a bit naughty.
You are encouraged to avoid this, and code a version that uses Google API
instead; I just needed a quick hack, which was OK for one-time use, but
may be less OK if the tool becomes popular.

Google folks: if you are reading this, I have used a distinct User-Agent
parameter for this code ("The Revisionist"). You may easily check for the
volume of traffic you are getting from this tool, and eventually drop
all requests if it becomes too much of a problem.

============
REQUIREMENTS
============

This tool currently runs only on Linux (although might work fine on
any compatible system with minor tweaks), and depends on the following:

  - Bourne Again Shell (bash), preferably 2.x
    http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html

  - wvWare toolkit 1.0.0 or newer - but NOT 2.x
    http://wvware.sf.net

  - libole2 - theoretically optional, used for username extraction only
    ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libole2/

  - A reasonably recent version of Lynx (preferably SSL-enabled)
    http://lynx.browser.org

Be sure that therev.conf (~/.therev.conf, /etc/therev.conf or 
./therev.conf) point to proper locations for all those programs.

============
INSTALLATION
============

The tool is not yet suitable for installation - simply compile it and
run.

If you really want to, you may manually put all files in /usr/local/therev,
then link ./usr/local/therev/therev to /usr/local/bin and put
therev.conf in /etc or ~/.therev.conf, changing file locations specified
in there.

================
SECURITY WARNING
================

Please note that wvWare is a fairly vulnerable beast, and so are my
hacked up shell scripts. It is theoretically possible for a malicious site
to exploit wvWare and gain control over your local system. As such, do not
run this script against sites or directories you have a damn good reason
to distrust.

=========
